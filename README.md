# StaticWebsiteReplica

In this assignment, you are given an image of a web page. Your task is to reproduce the page as closely as possible, writing HTML and CSS directly, that is without using anything more than a text editor. Screen shots of the web page to be imitated, to be scrolled vertically, can be found in the attached screenshots.zip.
• Video is available in the attached Static_Website_video.mov.
• Important Note: use of CSS is required
• You will need four (4) images to help you complete the web page: image1.png, image2.png, image3.png and flower.png.
• You should not use any other image.
